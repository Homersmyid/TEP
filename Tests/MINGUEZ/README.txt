This is to compare to the 6-bus problem used in Mínguez García-Bertrand's
“Robust Transmission Network Expansion Planning in Energy Systems: Improving Computational Performance.”

Since the Uncertainty Budget is defined different in the paper only the case with no uncertainty can be tested.

Also, these 6-bus results can be compared to GAMS solves.
